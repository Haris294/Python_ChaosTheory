# ChaosTheory
Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics that studies chaotic systems, which are dynamical systems driven by underlying patterns and deterministic rules that are extremely responsive to initial conditions.

Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary theory that states that underlying patterns, interconnectedness, endless feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization reside within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems.

An underlying theory of chaos is the butterfly effect, which explains how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system will result in significant changes in a later state (meaning that there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions).

A butterfly flapping its wings in Texas will cause a hurricane in China, according to a metaphor.

Here's a simple Python program depicting how Chaos theory works.
